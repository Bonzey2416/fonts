      <td class="normal medium"><i>Apollo 11</i> (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.</td>

      <td class="normal bold">The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second. The hertz is an SI derived unit whose expression in terms of SI base units is s−1, meaning that one hertz is the <i>reciprocal</i> of one second. It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857–1894), the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples: kilohertz (10^3 Hz, kHz), megahertz (10^6 Hz, MHz), gigahertz (10^9 Hz, GHz), terahertz (10^12 Hz, THz).</td>

    <tr>
      <td class=details>Extra Bold (800)</td>
      <td class="normal extra-bold">The hertz is defined as one cycle per second. The International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second as "the duration of 9192631770 periods of the <i>radiation</i> corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom" and then adds: "It follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium 133 atom is exactly 9192631770 hertz, ν(hfs Cs) = 9192631770 Hz." The dimension of the unit hertz is 1/time (1/T). Expressed in base SI units, the unit is 1/second (1/s).</td>

    <tr>
      <td class=details>Black (900)</td>
      <td class="normal black">The hertz is named after Heinrich Hertz. As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (Hz), but when written in full it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun; i.e., <i>"hertz"</i> becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles, but is otherwise in lower case.</td>
